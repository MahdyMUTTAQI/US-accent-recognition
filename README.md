# US-accent-recognition

In this project, I aimed to detect the US accent out of 6 different accents (Spanish, French, German, Italian, British, and American) using Machine Learning methods.

I approached the problem as a binary classification problem since I only wanted to detect The US accent and for that, I used 4 different Machine Learning methods: k-NN, SVM (Linear, RBF, and Polynomial), RBF, and Logistic Regression. I was able to obtain the highest accuracy (89.4%) with SVM (RBF).

I was also able to publish a bulletin for this project in IEEE. You can check the paper from this link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9925265
